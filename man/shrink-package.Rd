\title{Global, Parameterwise and Joint Shrinkage Factor Estimation}
\description{
The predictive value of a statistical model can often be improved by applying
shrinkage methods. This can be achieved, e.g., by regularized regression or
empirical Bayes approaches. Various types of shrinkage factors can also be
estimated after a maximum likelihood. While global shrinkage modifies all
regression coefficients by the same factor, parameterwise shrinkage factors
differ between regression coefficients. With variables which are either highly
correlated or associated with regard to contents, such as several columns of
a design matrix describing a nonlinear effect or two main effects and their
pairwise interaction term, parameterwise shrinkage factors are not interpretable
and a compromise between global and parameterwise shrinkage, termed 'joint
shrinkage', is a useful extension.
A computational shortcut to resampling-based shrinkage factor estimation based
on DFBETA residuals can be applied.
Global, parameterwise and joint shrinkage for models fitted by \code{lm},
\code{glm}, \code{coxph}, and \code{mfp} is available.
